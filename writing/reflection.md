## Instructions

Now that you are completed all six programs, take some time to reflect on what you learned. Answer each question thoughtfully and in complete sentences. These questions are designed to help you think conceptually about loops and programming, not just recall code syntax. Please use clear and meaningful language in your responses --no one-liners or single-word answers, please!

## Conceptual Questions

### Question 1: For Loops vs While Loops

In your own words, explain the main difference between a `for` loop and a `while` loop. When would you choose to use one over the other? Provide an example scenario for each.

**Your Answer:**

TODO: Write your answer here (3-5 sentences)

---

### Question 2: The Range Function

You used the `range()` function extensively in Program 1. Explain what `range(1, 10)`, `range(0, 20, 2)`, and `range(10, 0, -1)` each do. Why is the stop value "exclusive" (not included in the range)?

**Your Answer:**

TODO: Write your answer here (3-5 sentences)

---

### Question 3: String Iteration

In Program 2, you looped through a string character by character. Explain why we can iterate over strings using a `for` loop. What does this tell you about how Python treats strings?

**Your Answer:**

TODO: Write your answer here (2-4 sentences)

---

### Question 4: Nested Loops

Program 4 used nested loops to create patterns. Describe what happens when you have a loop inside another loop. How many times does the inner loop execute compared to the outer loop? Use an example from Program 4 to explain.

**Your Answer:**

TODO: Write your answer here (4-6 sentences)

### Question 5: Loop Control and Break Statements

In Program 3, you used a `break` statement in the password checker. Explain what the `break` statement does and why it's useful. Can you think of another scenario where using `break` would be helpful?

**Your Answer:**

TODO: Write your answer here (3-5 sentences)

---

### Question 6: Accumulator Pattern

Several programs used the "accumulator pattern" where you initialize a variable to 0 (or an empty string/list) and then add to it inside a loop. Why is this pattern so important in programming? Give at least two examples from the lab where you used this pattern.

**Your Answer:**

TODO: Write your answer here (4-6 sentences)

---

### Question 7: Lists vs Dictionaries

Both Program 5 and Program 6 involved iterating over collections, but lists and dictionaries are different. Explain the key difference between how you loop through a list versus a dictionary. What methods did you use for dictionary iteration?

**Your Answer:**

TODO: Write your answer here (3-5 sentences)

---

### Question 8: The Enumerate Function

You used `enumerate()` in Programs 2 and 5 to get both the index and the value while looping. Explain what `enumerate()` does and why it's more convenient than manually tracking an index with a counter variable.

**Your Answer:**

TODO: Write your answer here (3-4 sentences)

---

### Question 9: Real-World Applications

Think about real-world problems or situations where loops would be essential. Describe at least two specific examples of how loops could be used in everyday programs or applications (not from this lab).

**Your Answer:**

TODO: Write your answer here (4-6 sentences)

---

### Question 10: Debugging Loops

What was the most challenging bug or error you encountered while working on this lab? How did you figure out what was wrong? What debugging strategies did you use?

**Your Answer:**

TODO: Write your answer here (4-6 sentences)

---

## Lab Feedback

### Feedback Question 1: Lab Difficulty

How would you rate the difficulty of this lab? Were the programs appropriately challenging, too easy, or too difficult? Which program was the most challenging and why?

**Your Answer:**

TODO: Write your answer here (3-5 sentences)

---

### Feedback Question 2: Lab Improvements

What suggestions do you have for improving this lab? Was anything unclear in the instructions? Were the hints helpful? What would have made this lab better for your learning?

**Your Answer:**

TODO: Write your answer here (3-5 sentences)
